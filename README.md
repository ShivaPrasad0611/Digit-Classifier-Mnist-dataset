# MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Networks

## Description
This project uses the MNIST dataset from Keras to classify handwritten digits using a neural network. It demonstrates the implementation of a deep learning model for image classification.

## Features
- Uses the MNIST dataset for digit classification
- Implements a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trains and evaluates the model for accuracy
- Supports visualization of training progress and predictions

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ShivaPrasad0611/Digit-Classifier-Mnist-dataset.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd [your-repository](https://github.com/ShivaPrasad0611/Digit-Classifier-Mnist-dataset)
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to train and test the model:
```sh
python train.py  # or python mnist_nn.py
```
